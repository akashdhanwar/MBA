                TPS         -   Transaction Processing Systems
1.1         -   Introduction
Information -   An organised set of seemingly related data
                Meaningful/Processed data
System      -   Method or process of grouping things together
                It contains hardware, software, and a set of process to use that hardware/software to achieve a business task
                Example -   ATM system
IS          -   Information Systems
MIS         -   Management of Information Systems
What is an Information System   -   A set of interrelated components that collects, manipulate, store, and disseminate data and information and provide a feedback mechanism to meet an objective 
                                    Information System are a collection of computers, network, software and people who create, store, modify and distribute data and information in any organization.
                                    A computer based information system(CBIS) is a single set of hardware, software, databases, telecommunications, people, and procedures that are configured to collect, manipulate, store, and process data into information
                                    IT are the artefacts(Made by humans) such as computers, software and network that constitute the IS.
1.2         -   Modern Organization
TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS  -   1   -   IT Enabled Organization
                            2   -   Network Organization
                            3   -   Dispersed Organization
                            4   -   Knowledge Organization
1) IT Enabled Organization -    Organizations are collection of people with shared goals 
                                Has people or members who are engaged in activities for a common purpose
                                Organizations have many purpose 
                                1   -   Make Cars
                                2   -   Inform citizens
                                3   -   Ferry passengers
                                Example     -   SMALL SHOP USING COMPUTER FOR BILLING AND ATTENDANCE
                                Examples    -   Tata Motors, amazon, walmart, etc
2) Network Organizations   -    Organisations are collection of people with shared goals
                                Organisations are on digital networks linking them to others: Internet, Telecommunication
                                Requires sensing and responding to information flowing on the network
                                Responding to continuous flow of information also requires the organisation to adjust to meet the challenge
                                Example -   SMALL SHOP COMMUNICATING TO OUTSIDE WORLD(VENDORS, SUPPLIERS) THROUGH NETWORK
                                Example -   Schools use video conferencing equipment, Zomato network of restaurants, Ola 
3) Dispersed Organizations -    Organizations are highly dispersed: they have operations and offices in many cities within the same country and also abroad
                                Firms disperse their operations to best meet customer need or locate where resource are available
                                Example -   SMALL SHOP IS DISPERSED IN DIFFERENT AREAS
                                Example -   Iphone's Global supply chain, MNC's
4) Knowledge Organizations -    Modern organisations consists of knowledge worker - whose main job is to access and deal with knowledge and information
                                A major task of modern organizations is to process information 
                                Knowledge base - Information stored, processed and converted in to a form that can be used by organzations
                                Example -   PROCESSING OF INFORMATION
                                Example -   NASA/ISRO, Big 4, Data Scientist/Data Analyst/Data Engineer

IS vs IT    -   IT  -   It is the study, design, implementation, support or management of data within an Information System
                IS  -   IS refers to an entire set of information: not only the technology invilved, but the people(like stakeholders) and process as well
BPR -   Business Process Re-engineering -   Align process to system(technology)
Managing in the Internet Era    -   Organizations have to create a presence on the internet
                                    Challenge for organizations - find out most relevant and useful data 
                                    The Internet presents many security challenges
The IT Interaction Model        -   The Organization
                                    - Competitive environment
                                    - Strategy
                                    - Culture
                                    - IT Infrastruncture

                                    System Implementation Process
                                    - Initiation -> Build -> Introduction -> Maintainence

                                    Challenges of managing IS in organisations
                                    - Organizations do not remain static, they have to change to respond to the environment IS too continously evolves
                                    Importance to understand how IS and organizations interact
                                    When an organization builds an information system, 
                                    - The system may be used or not used, which may lead to positive or negative outcomes(e.g. payroll system)

                                    Outcomes will have
                                    First order effects
                                    - Outcomes that arise as a direct consequence of the introduction of a new IS are known as first order effects
                                    - Increased speed in data processing, increased volume of processing, gain the firm incurs on using IS
                                    - Sales increase, Customer satisfaction increase, turn-around time improve
                                    - Example - New server -> electricity bill increase
                                                Demonitisation Life miserable
                                                New ATM installed, users going to bank branch decrease
                                    Second order effects
                                    - Outcomes that are not immediately visible as they require years to become visible or measurable are known as second order effects
                                    - HR example: Hiring new employees is easy, retaining them is easy, new incentive schemes can be planned for the employees
                                    - Example - New ATM installed, Loss of interaction with banks
                                    Third order effects
                                    - Large scale benefits of using an IS
                                    - Example - New ATM installed, Rural banking is now possible. UPI

                                    Whether an IS is successful is largely dependent on 
                                    - The competitive environment of the firm (E-commerce)
                                    - The competitive strategy that the firm follows(DELL customised computers)
                                    - The work culture of the firm(Google)
                                    Information systems may impact the organization by 
                                    - Changing work processes and functions
                                    - Automate manual processes
                                    - Eliminate some work processes
                                    Building an IS requires choices to be made - MAKE vs BUY
                                    - Build the system, if internal skills are available
                                    - Buy the system 
                                    Initiation requires understanding the need for the IS
                                    Analysis is required understanding the specification for the system
                                    A new system has to be introduced and integrated with the organization
Challenges for the Managers     -   A manager who has manage the IS of an organisation faces many challenges
                                    Which system to build?
                                    - New IS or make IS
                                    How much to spend on IS?
                                    - Very difficult to answer. See what competitors are doing 
                                    What level of capabilities should be created with the IS?

                                    Primary partners or all stakeholders
                                    Use Internet or Intranet
                                    How centralised should the service be?
                                    - The syatem should be both scalable and flexible
                                    What security levels are requires?
                                    - Security has to be adequate without being cumbersome and expensive
                                    What is the technology road map for the organization?
                                    - Rolling out in phases

SMRT(Singapore MRT) Corporation -   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWIfJlyOmw
Case Study  -   Indian Railways -   Passenger Reservation System - Passengers can check the current position on any train, make a reservation from origin to destination anywhere in India, pay for the ticket with any of several means including with a credit card, use a printout of a ticket to board a train
                                    Freight Operation Information System(FOIS) - Real-time update on where the freight trains are, how many rakes are being used, how many are idle, where they are located and where they are needed.
                                    Crew Management System(CMS) - Know where the crew are located, when they arrived there and how long they have waited.
                                                                  The crew payment schedule, their experience with different locomotives, their duty allocation and their training schedule among other information
                                    Integrated Management Coaching System(ICMS) - View in real time manner where each passenger train is located at any time
                                                                                  Traffic managers can delay or speed up trains near bottlenecks so that the overall traffic movement is smooth
Control Office Application(COA) -   Developed by CRIS
                                    Train operations on Indian Railways are controlled and monitored by the Control rooms in each of the divisional/area control offices.
                                    The control room is the nerve centre of the division. The fluidity of train movements over the jurisdiction of the division is dependent on the efficiency of the Control room operations.
                                    The Control Office, by its very nature never shuts down and works all hours of the day and every day of the week. 
                                    The Control Office application has changed the way the trains are monitored as train movements are captured near real time and movement of scheduled and unscheduled trains are planned and controlled through the computer aided interface.

    Principal Resources in a Firm
    -   Capital/Money
    -   Labour
    -   Material
    -   Information

Information as a Resource   -   In modern organisations, information, data and information systems are used extensively within and across organizational functions, across hierarchies.
                                Typical functions in an organization include accounting and finance, marketing, operations, human resource management and information systems management.
                                Example -   Tickets have a PNR number

Information in organizational Functions-
    -   Accounting Function -   Income/Expenditure, Profit/Loss, Revenue, Transactions, Cash Flow, Tax-related Information, Audit.
    -   Marketing Function  -   Customer Information, Competitor Information, Advertisement, Sales Data, Campaigns, Trends, Customer Insights, Market Analysis, Macro Economy Analysis.
    -   HR Function         -   Appraisals, Recruitment, Payroll, Performance Monitoring, Learning and Development, Attrition/Loyalty, Statuory Compliances


Types of Information Technology
    Historically, information was designed for specific functions within organizations 
    Modern information systems are designed largely to support individuals, groups and enterprise functions
    -   Functional IT is used by individuals for their own work
    -   Network IT is used within functions to collaborate/communicate within the group. 
    -   Enterprise IT id designed for processes in the organization and is very efficient in moving data between different functions and to communicate with outside partners.

Types of Information Systems: 
Transaction Processing System
    -   Transaction processing systems record all transactions as they happens, storing transaction data and preserving a digital record of the functioning of the enterprise.
    -   They are designed to respond quickly to the user, through carefully designed interfaces that guide users through various transactions.
Management Information System
