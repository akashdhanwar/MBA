Case Study  -   Tata Motors
                Network of over 2000 Vendors
                IS = Supply Chain Management System
                Hours to 24 Hours
                100 Passenger Cars
                Door Handles
                1   -   Informs Production Schedule Production plan(How many items Needed)

ERP         -   Enterprise resource planning - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HfNg4a_Og
                Examples    -   SAP, Oracle ERP, Tally ERP
                TPS         -   Transaction Processing Systems
Information -   An organised set of seemingly related data
                Meaningfull/Processed data
System      -   Method or process of grouping things together
                It contains hardware, software, and a set of process to use that hardware/software to achieve a business task
                Example -   ATM system
IS          -   Information Systems
MIS         -   Management of Information Systems
What is an Information System   -   A set of interrelated components that collects, manipulate, store, and disseminate data and information and provide a feedback mechanism to meet an objective 
                                    Information System are a collection of computers, network, software and people who create, store, modify and distribute data and information in any organization.
                                    A computer based information system(CBIS) is a single set of hardware, software, databases, telecommunications, people, and procedures that are configured to collect, manipulate, store, and process data into information
                                    IT are the artefacts(Made by humans) such as computers, software and network that constitute the IS.

TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS  -   1   -   IT Enabled Organization
                            2   -   Network Organization
                            3   -   Dispersed Organization
                            4   -   Knowledge Organization
1) IT Enabled Organization -    Organizations are collection of people with shared goals 
                                Has people or members who are engaged in activities for a common purpose

                                Organisations are on digital networks linking them to others: Internet, Telecommunication
                                Requires sensing and responding to information flowing on the network
                                Responding to continuous flow of information also requires the organisation to adjust to meet the challenge
                                Example -   SMALL SHOP COMMUNICATING TO OUTSIDE WORLD(VENDORS, SUPPLIERS) THROUGH NETWORK
                                Example -   Schools use video conferencing equipment, Zomato network of restaurants, Ola 
3) Dispersed Organizations -    Organizations are highly dispersed: they have operations and offices in many cities within the same country and also abroad
                                Firms disperse their operations to best meet customer need or locate where resource are available

                                Knowledge base - Information stored, processed and converted in to a form that can be used by organzations
                                Example -   PROCESSING OF INFORMATION
                                Example -   NASA/ISRO, Big 4, Data Scientist/Data Analyst/Data Engineer
