Financial Statements consist of 4 parts
1) Balanced Sheet -     A statement of the assets, liabilities, and Equity(Capital of a business or other organization at a particular point in time), detailing the balance of income and expenditure over the preceding period.
                        Shows what a company owns and what it owes
                        Assets = Equity + Liabilities
                        Asset       -   Assets are the items your company owns that can provide future economic benefit
                                        Current Assets      -   Which can be cashed in less than 1 year 
                                        Non-Current Assets  -   Which cannot be cased in less than 1 year
                        Liability   -   Liabilities are what you owe other parties
                                        Liabilities are the obligations and debts a company owes
                                        Current liability       -   Which we have to pay in less than 1 year
                                        Non-Current Liability   -   Which we dont have to pay in less than 1 year
                        In short, assets put money in your pocket, and liabilities take money out!
                        Expenses can be paid immediately with cash, or the payment could be delayed which would create a liability
